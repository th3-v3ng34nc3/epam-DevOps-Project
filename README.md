Project: Continuous Deployment Pipeline for a Web Application

Description:
I will build a continuous deployment pipeline for a web application. The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the application to a staging environment when changes are made to the codebase. Once the changes have been verified in the staging environment, the pipeline will automatically deploy the changes to the production environment.

Tools and Technologies:
-	Git for version control
-	Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment
-	Docker for containerization
-	Kubernetes for container orchestration
-	Ansible for configuration management
- AWS for hosting the web application
	
Steps:

-	Set up a Git repository for the web application codebase.
-	Create a Jenkins pipeline that will listen for changes to the codebase and trigger a build, test, and deployment process.
-	Configure Jenkins to use Docker to build and package the application into a container image.
-	Set up a Kubernetes cluster and configure it to automatically deploy the application to a staging environment.
-	Create an Ansible playbook to configure the application for the production environment.
-	Configure Jenkins to automatically deploy the application to the production environment using Ansible.

Deliverables:

-	A working continuous deployment pipeline for the web application.
-	Documentation that outlines the pipeline and how to use it.
-	Code for the Jenkins pipeline, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, and Ansible playbook.
